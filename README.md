NOAA Weather Dataset - JFK Airport

Overview

This project is centred around the NOAA weather dataset collected at JFK Airport. The dataset includes hourly weather observations such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other meteorological factors from 2010 to 2018. It was sourced as part of an open data initiative and provided under the CDLA-Sharing 1.0 license. The key objective of this project was to explore, clean, and analyse this dataset, while adhering to ethical data usage practices.

The Source

The dataset comes from the NOAA JFK weather station and is shared under the CDLA-Sharing 1.0 license. This license allows usage, analysis, and sharing of data without adding restrictions, as long as appropriate credit is given. This has been an excellent opportunity to explore open data and understand the value of transparency and collaboration in data science.

What Was Done

Data Exploration:

Inspected the dataset for its structure and completeness.

Identified missing values and patterns.

Data Cleaning:

Dropped columns with excessive missing data (e.g., over 80%).

Removed Fahrenheit temperature columns since Celsius data was complete.

Converted data types where necessary (e.g., ensuring dates and numeric columns were properly formatted).

Analysis and Visualisation:

Examined the relationship between humidity and temperature using scatter plots.

Created histograms to visualise the distribution of wind speed.

Explored hourly weather trends for specific years (e.g., 2017).

Key Insights Gained:

Learned to work with open-source datasets and understand licensing.

Gained practical experience in handling missing data.

Practiced creating meaningful visualisations to summarise and communicate insights.

Key Takeaways

Open data, like the NOAA dataset, provides a valuable resource for learning and experimentation in data science.

The importance of ethical data usage, including proper attribution and adherence to licensing agreements.

Handling missing values and cleaning data is a critical and unavoidable part of working with real-world datasets.

Visualisation is not just a presentation tool but a powerful method for uncovering insights.

Idea Origin

This project idea stemmed from the Sharing Enterprise Data - Data Asset Exchange module of a Coursera data science course. It was designed to provide hands-on experience with real-world data, focusing on weather patterns and their implications.

Educational Purpose

The primary goal of this project was to develop skills in:

Data preparation and cleaning.

Exploratory data analysis.

Applying licensing knowledge to ensure compliance when using shared data.

This project was undertaken with an emphasis on learning and experimentation, making it a valuable step towards building a strong foundation in data science.
